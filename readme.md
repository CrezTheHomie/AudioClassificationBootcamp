The purpose of this repository is going to be planning out the learning required that I will need as well as practicing the different classifications for the program I'm thinking of building.
The program I'm thinking of building is going to be a software solution that mixes an audio classifier for recognizing an accent based on an audio stream as well as live feedback building a transcript of speech and showing what that transcript would look like with a different accent.

Seperated out, the steps I need to learn are:
1. Make a transcript of the audio by recognizing human speech.
2. Make an IPA transcript of audio from human speech.
3. Use a model to predict accent based on human speech.
